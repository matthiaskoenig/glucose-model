Model_V4
------------------------------------------
Simplified hepatic glucose model consisting of 5 core concentrations.
- C1 : glucose extern
- C2 : glucose 
- C3 : glycogen
- C4 : lactate
- C5 : lactate extern

Contains 
- glycogen storage and utilization.
- switch between HGP & HGP
- different set points for glycogen metabolism and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis
- direct and indirect glycogen synthesis
