Despite the crucial role of the liver in glucose homeostasis, a detailed mathematical
model of human hepatic glucose metabolism is lacking so far. Here we present, a
detailed kinetic model of glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and glycogen metabolism in
human hepatocytes integrated with the hormonal control of these pathways by insulin,
glucagon and epinephrine. Model simulations are in excellent agreement with
experimental data on (i) the quantitative contributions of glycolysis, gluconeogenesis,
and glycogen metabolism to hepatic glucose production and hepatic glucose utilization
under varying physiological states. (ii) the time courses of postprandial glycogen
storage as well as glycogen depletion in overnight fasting and short term fasting (iii) the
switch from hepatic glucose production under hypoglycemia to hepatic glucose
utilization under hyperglycemia essential for glucose homeostasis. Response analysis
reveals an extra high capacity of the liver to counteract changes of plasma glucose
level below 5 mM (hypoglycemia) and above 7.5 mM (hyperglycemia). Our model may
serve as an important module of a whole-body model of human glucose metabolism
and as a valuable tool for understanding the role of the liver in glucose homeostasis
under normal conditions and in diseases like diabetes or glycogen storage diseases.
